Meeting Minutes:
Process and Procedures:
•	There is a documented process for AI that is currently in the approval cycle and was the result of an initiative by IT Governance through a Kick-off meeting with the Enterprise Security (Based on ISO 42000).

Mainly the AI team delivers three types of projects (Their scope of work):
•	Advanced Analytics:
- Building up on the current data layer as they have a Database (Teradata) that contains all transaction.
-Through transforming the current transactions from its raw form into an advanced analytics data layer.
-To develop outputs such as the customers’ interests.
-Can be utilized for many purposes.
-Has a standalone KPI and is included in the Dashboards.
-integrates in the campaign layers.

•	Prediction:
-Used in predicting many customers’ activities such as recharge, shopping and inactivity.
-Also used in campaigns and offers as it provides more feasibility and avoids wasted efforts in giving offers to non-eligible customers.

•	AI:
-Extracting certain types of information (such as National ID no.) from inputs.
-Generating outputs from raw data.
-Include fields as NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Computer vision.

Copilot Tool:
•	Part of the agreement with Teams and is a closed solution from Microsoft.
•	Not related to the AI Team.

Communications with the Group:
There were 2 communications:
•	A communication regarding an engagement with Gartner to assess the maturity of AI in Eand through a questionnaire.
•	A communication with Eand Emirates through which they exchanged challenges and recommendations.
The AI team may also present major use cases to the Group in forums.

Use Cases:
•	There are 2 types of Use Cases (Rule-based & Chat GPT-Like), However all the use cases in production are rule-based only.
•	They are projects injected in the business to facilitate the operations
•	The use cases are monitored in terms of performance.
•	There are dashboards for the use cases insights.
•	Majority of the uses cases are internal (support Eand’s operation/business teams)

The AI team provide use cases upon the business demand, as follows:
•	The business requests a use case from the AI team.
•	The AI team determines the project type whether advances analytics or machine learning use case, etc..
•	The AI team then determines the relevant data needed for the use case.
•	The needed data could be available in DWH and if not the team requesting the use case should provide the data.
•	Then the AI team follows some development steps as: understanding the data source – exploring the data – transforming/cleansing the data.

Database:
•	Teradata same as DWH.
•	Has mainly the DWH data.
•	Current version 17.20, was last updated in December 2024.
•	Stores the analysis data performed by the AI.
•	Based on Operating System: Linux type SUSE, version SLES 12 (out of SA team scope of administration) also managed by the Database team.

Application:
•	There is no Application.

Machine:
•	Dedicated to analysis projects.
•	There is a GUI which is a script that executes some commands and then stores all data in Teradata.
•	The machine type in Linux

Integrations:
•	From AI team POV, there is no integration as the team depends on data already available in the database and the outputs then are stored in specific fields.

Access Management:
•	Depends on the type of project whether analytics through the Database or Machine learning through development machine (Python).
•	Database: 
-The Database user is considered the access.
-Each AI team member has a database user with their NT account.
-Through the database user, they create scripts (mostly sequel) which is then used to create the change requests.
-Request management for DB & OS: the database creates the access requests. 
•	Development Machine:
-AI team also have users in the machine
•	Linux Machine:
-There is only one user on the machine that creates the scripts and executes them and then stores the data in Teradata.

Project Management Process:
•	Included in the process.
•	Differs depending on the size of the project and they classify the projects in the initiation phase.
•	If a major project, it follows the Project management project.
•	If a minor project, the flow is directly to the AI team and deployed quickly.

Change Management Process:
•	The AI Team follows the same IT Change management process.

Incident Management Process:
•	Incidents are managed through 2 ways.
1-The team identifies the failed cases through the dashboard and send them to the IT Support to be handled right away.
2-Individual cases from the Business are handled through E-mails.

Capacity Management:
•	Part is handled by the Database team and another is handled by the IT Capacity Management.

Backup:
•	Is handled by the Database team.

AI Team:
•	Around 20-25 team members.

Initial Requirements:
•	The Process and procedures
•	Documented Workflows and framework
•	List of all use cases and projects in production
•	Sample of business cases for running use cases
•	Sample from the dashboard (October 2025)
•	Screenshot of the Teradata version
•	Screenshot of the type and version of Teradata operating system 
•	IP addresses and hostnames of all servers and databases
•	Screenshot of the type and version of the machine
•	Integration between AI system and Teradata DB (used tables to get data and to store output data)
•	Change requests service name
•	Sample from the change requests
•	Sample from the incident management Emails 
•	Sample from the communication between the Team and IT support to solve failed cases (incident management)
•	Sample of communication between AI team and another team requesting a use case
•	Business case/Case study for new requested hardware to obtain GPU for running AI

Best regards,
