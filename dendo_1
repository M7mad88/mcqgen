Good day to you,
Thank you for your feedback and for highlighting the areas that need further clarification. Below are the requested details:
1.	Example Data Mart Models for Insights:
•	Subscriber Data Mart:
Model: Subscriber profiles, churn indicators, engagement metrics, recharges, revenue, and renewals, etc.
•	Marketing Data Mart:
Model: Digital Interactions, Campaign illegibility and opt-ins, etc.
•	Network/Usage Data Mart:
Model: Usage patterns, device segmentation, etc.
Integration Logic:
Join on subscriber ID across marts (mostly) → derive features like engagement score, usage drop, and campaign response → correlate churn prediction models.
2.	Key Business Questions & Expected Insights
Here are examples of questions and insights we aim to generate:
Business Question	Expected Insight
Which subscriber segments have the highest churn risk in the next quarter?	Predictive churn scores by segment with top contributing factors.
How does marketing spend correlate with customer retention?	Correlation analysis showing ROI of campaigns on churn reduction.
