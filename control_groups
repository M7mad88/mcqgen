Hello Mostafa,

As discussed, we need to be able to extract the DSL dials having criteria similar to the attached: full utilizers who did not purchase addons during the past 2 months.

As for the control group: its sizing would be 2k and it shall be representitative on the below attributes:

•	ARPU
•	Usage
•	Outgoing activity flag
•	Rate plan mix
•	Status
•	Tenurity
•	Digital engagement 
•	DSL over fixed flag
•	DSL over Emerald flag

Kindly adjust the sample size to be 5%-10% of the 50k offer base.

Thank you,
